# Project Description
The goal of this project was to develop an interface that lets you control your computer entirely through hand gestures, no physical input needed. Wave your hand in front of the computer to simulate mouse cursor movement, and pinch your fingers in various ways to control clicking and scrolling.

The finished project uses the Java Programing Language, along with a LeapMotion and the LeapMotion SDK. The LeapMotion tracks the movement of your hands, and the Java code gets the data from the LeapMotion and uses it in order to simulate a mouse cursor. We use an arduino with various sensors in order to simulate various actions when certain finger gestures are made.
